# Calculator

## This is a calculator project from 'The Odin Project'

- Used: JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

- Optional:

  - [x] Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display).

  - [x] Calculations can be chained.

  - [x] Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.

  - [x] Add keyboard support.

  - [x] Make it look nice!

- Future Plans:

  - [ ] update to a more comprehensive README.


### Comments

> This was first calculator attempt using an array in the logic. Overall it was good experience in learning however my approach was too complex weaving through various array methods. In the end I found a simpler logic of using variables to store inputs.
